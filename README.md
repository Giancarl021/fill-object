# fill-object

Fill deep properties missing in an object based on a default object
## Similar projects

* [Lodash/defaultsDeep](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#defaultsDeep) - Lodash function;
* [defaults](https://www.npmjs.com/package/defaults) - NPM package;

## Why?

This package is a simple and lightweight alternative to the Lodash function, to fill an partial object with a default value. This package is made specifically to deal with nested options objects, where a schema must be followed, so, as a side-effect, any property that is not in the schema will be removed.
